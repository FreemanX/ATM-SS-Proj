# HKBU COMP4007 ATM-SS-Project

## Development log
======================Nov 1st, 2015 Freeman======================

0. Project website launched! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
1. All classes defined in phase 1 have been created, yet the methods, attributes and detailed code of those classes are still empty. Some methods may be changed later. The class diagram has been updated accordingly. 
2. The sample codes provided by Joe are also included for now. Those code can only be > reference as mentioned in the lecture.

==============


### Notice
There is a "mistake" in BAMSHandler.java, line 134.
"toAcc=" should be "&toAcc=", whenever you try to use the transfer method, append a "&" behind the cred.

e.g

handler.transfer(cardNo, cred + "&", accNo, toAcc, amount)


======================Nov 11st, 2015 Freeman======================
So far what we have done:
0. All the finctions of hardware emulators have finished. They are not fully tested though, maybe modified little in the future.
	To Check:
		0.1. Add functions for them accroding to the requirnment
		0.2. When the status of a emulator is set to be not working by Exceptioin emulator, all the functions (functionnal buttons) of the corresponding hw should be disabled
		0.3. The status of a hardware emulator can be changed by ATM-SS or Exceptioin emulator independently. The status lables on the Exception emulator should be synchronized.

1. Tony has finished the php part, need to be tested by handler.
